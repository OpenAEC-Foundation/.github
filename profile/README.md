# Open AEC Foundation

**Developing, supporting and promoting open source software for the entire construction chain.**

The Open AEC Foundation is dedicated to creating accessible, high-quality open source tools for the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) industry. We believe in collaboration, transparency, and shared innovation.

## Our Projects

### BIM & Building Modeling

| Project | Vision & Application |
|---------|---------------------|
| [building.py](https://github.com/OpenAEC-Foundation/building.py) | Programmatically create building models and export to industry platforms like Blender, Revit, IFC, and Speckle. Automates repetitive design tasks for architects and engineers. |
| [INB-Template](https://github.com/OpenAEC-Foundation/INB-Template) | Standardized IFC templates for the Dutch construction sector. Provides NEN47-compliant materials and building elements for consistent BIM workflows. |

### Viewers & Visualization

| Project | Vision & Application |
|---------|---------------------|
| [monty-IFC-viewer](https://github.com/OpenAEC-Foundation/monty-IFC-viewer) | Lightweight, accessible IFC viewer. View BIM models without expensive software licenses. |
| [CPT-viewer](https://github.com/OpenAEC-Foundation/CPT-viewer) | Visualize geotechnical soil investigation data (CPT). Essential for foundation engineering and site analysis. |
| [Open-2D-Studio](https://github.com/OpenAEC-Foundation/Open-2D-Studio) | Cross-platform document viewer for reviewing technical drawings and specifications. |

### Data & Integration

| Project | Vision & Application |
|---------|---------------------|
| [Project-Ocondat](https://github.com/OpenAEC-Foundation/Project-Ocondat) | Open building data repository. Centralizes steel profiles, Eurocode standards, and construction specifications from WikiData and other sources. |
| [GIS2BIM-OpenAnalysis](https://github.com/OpenAEC-Foundation/GIS2BIM-OpenAnalysis) | Bridge geographic data with building models. Integrate terrain, infrastructure, and environmental data into BIM projects. |
| [IfcGit4NextCloud](https://github.com/OpenAEC-Foundation/IfcGit4NextCloud) | Version control for IFC files within NextCloud. Track changes and collaborate on BIM models. |

### Office & Productivity

| Project | Vision & Application |
|---------|---------------------|
| [Open-PDF-Creator](https://github.com/OpenAEC-Foundation/Open-PDF-Creator) | Generate professional PDFs from technical documents and drawings. |
| [Open-Report-Builder-Studio](https://github.com/OpenAEC-Foundation/Open-Report-Builder-Studio) | Create complete engineering reports by combining documents, calculations, and drawings. Integrated with AI and ERPNext for automation. |
| [Open-Calc](https://github.com/OpenAEC-Foundation/Open-Calc) | Open source cost estimation for construction projects. Transparent pricing without vendor lock-in. |

### Scripts & Libraries

| Project | Vision & Application |
|---------|---------------------|
| [AEC-Scripts](https://github.com/OpenAEC-Foundation/AEC-Scripts) | Ready-to-use scripts for common AEC workflows. Automate calculations, conversions, and data processing. |

### Knowledge Preservation

| Project | Vision & Application |
|---------|---------------------|
| [OpenBooks](https://github.com/OpenAEC-Foundation/OpenBooks) | Digitizing historical architectural and construction literature. Preserving building knowledge for future generations. |

### Infrastructure & Automation

| Project | Vision & Application |
|---------|---------------------|
| [nextcloud-talk-erp-next-bot](https://github.com/OpenAEC-Foundation/nextcloud-talk-erp-next-bot) | Connect team communication with business processes. Chat-based access to ERPNext data. |
| [NextCloud-Claude-Bot](https://github.com/OpenAEC-Foundation/NextCloud-Claude-Bot) | AI assistant integrated in NextCloud. Smart support for document management and workflows. |
